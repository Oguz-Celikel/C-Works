	Write a program that generates N random values of type integer within a range specified by
scanf commands. These values should be stored in an array. The output of the program
should be a graphical histogram such as the one shown in the example at the bottom of the
page.
	Your program should compute the number of occurrences for each possible value between
min_value and max_value by checking values of the elements of array which stores
the numbers. For each value within the specified range the character `x` should be appended
as many times as the number of occurrence.
	Note that both N and the difference between max_value and min_value should be less
than 100. You will need to store numbers and occurrence counts in static arrays of size 100.
If N or the max_value - min_value difference is over 100, your program should quit
with a warning message.



Example run:

>Enter N Value (e.g. 100) : 100
>Enter Min Value (e.g. 0) : 0
>Enter Max Value (e.g. 10) : 10
>Histogram of the N=100 random numbers is as follows
>
> 0 xxxx
> 1 xxxxxxx
> 2 xxxxxxxx
> 3 xxxxxxxxxxx
> 4 xxxxxxxxxxx
> 5 xxxxxxxxxxx
> 6 xxxxxxxxxxxxx
> 7 xxxxxxxxxxxx
> 8 xxxxxxxxx
> 9 xxxxxxxx
>10 xxxxxx
>
>Exiting now...
